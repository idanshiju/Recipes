    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Jackfruit Chips or Chakka Upperi is a popular (and favorite) teatime snack in South India. These are crispy, crunchy, and tasty and you would munch on them without a care in the world!</p>
    <p>Jackfruit Chips is a really popular snack and is prepared by deep frying half-ripe jackfruit flesh.</p>
    <p>Jackfruit trees are common in most of the backyards of Kerala homes and April to June is the best season of jackfruits. There is an overload of jackfruit recipes in our homes throughout these months- sweet and savory dishes made with raw and ripe jackfruits, jackfruit seeds, and what not!</p>
    <p>Jackfruit is referred to as mock meat because of its meaty texture. No wonder we make Kathal Biriyani, Kathal Pickles, and Sabzi!</p>
    <p>I can truly understand the affinity towards Kathal ki Sabji which is popular in other parts of our country. I'd still urge you to try the multiple varieties of jackfruit dishes that we have to offer in Kerala. Must try if you come over to the state during this time of the year.</p>
